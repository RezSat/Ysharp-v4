**Ysharp is a high level general-purpose programming language that is inspired by C and Python.**

# Whats New in Y#(Y-sharp) v4

```
builtin numpy arrays
builtin speak functions (male/female voices)
ability of adding Python Code to the Ysharp file to devlop new libraries
Used sly for Lexer & Parser
```

# Why Y#(Y-sharp)?
- It's a versatile programming language suited for many things
- New features are constantly being added
- Built-in libraries & functions for Robotic Engineering & Computer Automation

# Tools used

- [Sly lex yacc](https://github.com/dabeaz/sly) used for parsing
- Python 3 (can be used with [CPython](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [PyPy](https://pypy.org/))

# Examples can be found in '/examples' directory

# Basic Usage
To use, run the filename as the first argument. It is recommended to use the python interpreter to run the code (just run the `ysharp` folder), like so:

```
python3 ysharp path/to/yharp/file.yshp

or

python ysharp path/to/yharp/file.yshp 
```

The filename for yharp files is `.yshp`. For example, `important_file.yshp`. If you want to use the compiled binaries, on Unix-like systems, you could do:

```
./ysharp.bin path/to/ysharp/file.yshp
```
