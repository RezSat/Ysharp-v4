# Ysharp-v4
Y#(Y-sharp) version 4 is now released.
**Ysharp is a high level general-purpose programming language that is inspired by C and Python.**

# Whats New in Y#(Y-sharp) v4

```
builtin numpy arrays
builtin speak functions (male/female voices)
ability of adding Python Code to the Ysharp file to devlop new libraries
Used sly for Lexer & Parser
```

# Why Y#(Y-sharp)?
- It's a versatile programming language suited for many things
- Built-in libraries & functions for Robotic Engineering & Computer Automation
- Really, no one need to use it, it's just a pet project

# All Features

There are constantly new features being developed in Y#(Y-sharp).

- [x] Classes
- [x] Functions
- [x] Built-Ins (e.g. print, get, stdin, to_int)
- [x] Primitive Types (Integers, Floats, Booleans, Strings)
- [x] Python Lists, Tuples and Numpy Arrays Builtin
- [x] While loops
- [x] For Loops
- [x] Import statements
- [ ] C-like Structs
- [ ] Switch Statements
- [ ] Syntax Changeable at Runtime

# Tools used

- [Sly lex yacc](https://github.com/dabeaz/sly) used for parsing
- Python 3 (can be used with [CPython](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [PyPy](https://pypy.org/))

# Examples can be found in '/examples' directory

# Basic Usage
To use, run the filename as the first argument. It is recommended to use the python interpreter to run the code (just run the `ysharp` folder), like so:

```
python3 ysharp path/to/yharp/file.yshp

or

python ysharp path/to/yharp/file.yshp 
```

The filename for yharp files is `.yshp`. For example, `important_file.yshp`. If you want to use the compiled binaries, on Unix-like systems, you could do:

```
./ysharp.bin path/to/ysharp/file.yshp
```
